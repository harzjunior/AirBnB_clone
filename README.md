# AirBnB Clone

## Step One: Developing a Command Interpreter for Managing AirBnB Objects

This marks the initial phase in constructing your inaugural web application, the AirBnB clone. This preliminary step carries immense significance as it sets the foundation for all forthcoming projects in the series, such as HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API development, and front-end integration.

Each task within this phase is intricately connected and contributes to the following objectives:

* Establish a parent class named [BaseModel] responsible for the initialization, serialization, and deserialization of your future instances.
* Create a straightforward process for serialization and deserialization: Instance ↔ Dictionary ↔ JSON string ↔ file.
* Develop all the classes necessary for the AirBnB application (e.g., [User, State, City, Place...]) that inherit from the [BaseModel] class.
* Implement the initial abstracted storage engine for the project, known as File storage.
* Create comprehensive unit tests to validate all our classes and the storage engine's functionality.
